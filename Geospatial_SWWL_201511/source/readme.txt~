To use the source codes, one need to have gcc complier and Matlab installed on a linux/unix system.
Before simulation, open and edit the Bash script simulate.sh and specify the
actual Matlab installing path in Line 12, and the predefined parameters from
Line 15 to Line 21. Within these parameters, 'Stamp' refers to time stamp and is
used specify different simulation realizations. 'Nodes' and 'Degree' refer to
the network size and degree for generated scale-free networks. 'DataDef'
specify the total sampling data point recorded from the time series generation
code. The parameter 'NmDef' is list of normalized amount of required
measurements, and 'EpsDef' is list of tolerance level in compressive sensing
algorithm (see Method for detail description.) Both of these two parameters
follow the definition of vector in Matlab. The 'RepTimeDef' defines the repeated
realizations in network reconstruction.

Then one may open a terminal and change directory to the file location, and change 
permission for 'simulate.sh':
	chmod +x ./simulate.sh
and then execute it to perform simulation by
	./simulate.sh  
	
The script will automatically generate a geospatial scale free network and 
simulate time series for the coupled dynamics on it. It will also
generate the Matlab code to reconstruct networks and geospatial information
from simulated time series, store the reconstruction results in Matlab data storage
format (*.mat file) and plot results by calling Matlab.

The required source codes for this script and their functionalities are listed as follows.

1. dataioV1.h is a header file written by Dr. Xuan Ni (http://chaos34.eas.asu.edu/) and revised 
by Dr. Riqi Su. It provides functions in C programming environment to read and write 
Matlab data storage format, to realize efficient data structure for matrix and vector, and to 
generate high quality random variables.

2. BANet.cpp was used to generate specific scale free random networks of given
network sizes and average degrees.

3. DDEv3.cpp was used to generate time series for Rossler oscillators with delayed
coupled on given scale free networks. It will return a 'TimeSer*.mat' file.

4. l1-magic codes located in directory /Optimization. The source codes were previously
downloaded from http://users.ece.gatech.edu/justin/l1magic/ and they are used here 
to solve the sparse regulation problem.

5. localize2d.m was provided by A. H. Sayed et al.,  in Network-based Wireless Location, 
IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, Vol. 24, No. 4, 2005. It is called by triLocation.m 
to solve the triangle localization problem with given distance matrix.

6. matlab_BANet.m is matlab code to reconstruct geospatial network from time series
and was written by the authors.

In the final stored *.mat file, there are some importance variables.
The StoreCoup is the $W_{nz}$, which is the mean normalized errors for reconstructed 
coupling weights of the existed links. The StoreDelay is $D_{nz}$, the mean normalized 
errors for coupling delays of the existed links. And zStoreCoup and zStoreDelay are 
$W_{z}$ and $D_{z}$, respectively, which are the average of absolute error for the weights
or delays associated with non-existed links. Please refer to the Method section and 
Figure 3 for detailed discussion.
